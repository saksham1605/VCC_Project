# CS695 Assignment 4

Working set size is the amount of memory a program or a virtual machine
(VM) needs to do its job effectively. It is important to get the working set size
of a VM so that memory can be efficiently managed according to the usage of
each VM. We can make sure each VM gets enough memory without wasting
resources. In this project, we will find out the working set size of the VM using
our implementation of QEMU/KVM virtualization
